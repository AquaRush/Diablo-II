<hr>## Changes</hr>
Date - 07/02/2017;
- Slightly updated the script for better King detection and ivasion.
- It is highly recommended to use "NTConfig_CowKingChicken" set to value "95".

<hr>## Tests</hr>
I personally have tested the script and it works flawlessly on Sorceress, it is strognly recommended not to use Paladin with this script as tests have shown that Hammer's angle sometimes kills the King from long distance.
For any other bugs, describe them in the comments with as much information as possible and with any code modifications you have done.
